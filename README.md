Advent of Code 2025
https://adventofcode.com/2025
Welcome to my attempt at the 2025 Advent of Code challenge.

I have used Python but I have not tried to write crazy-short concise one liner solutions. I have gone for a readable and hopefully easy to understand approach with plenty of comments and useful named variables.

My solutions aren't neccessarily the fastest or best way of solving each problem, but I hope they are logical and sensible!
